# ConcurrencyBenchmarks
... is a set of concurrency benchmarks mostly taken from https://github.com/mc-imperial/sctbench.git. Currently it contains mostly benchmarks with data races. This repository was created as a benchmark suite for the tool Actul (https://github.com/marchartung/Actul) and provides no warranty or anything. 

Please notice the license restrictions in the subfolders. 

Special thanks to the Department of Computing of the Imperial College London. They provided most of the test cases in their SCTBench-Suite. Please take a look at their repository for more interesting test cases.
